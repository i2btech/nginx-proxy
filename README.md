# nginx-proxy

# Purpose

This docker image can be use to expose a backend service using nginx, we use letsencrypt to generate SSL certiticates.
This can be use also as a dummy container to expose a service un k8s, aws ecs, etc.

# Examples

`Dockerfile` to build an image of the proxy:

```
FROM  i2btech/nginx-proxy:latest
COPY nginx-vhost.conf /devops/nginx-vhost.conf
CMD ["-r"]
```

`nginx-vhost.conf` to define vhost(s) configuration:
```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name demo-proxy.i2btech.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name demo-proxy.i2btech.com;

    root /var/www/html;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/proxy/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/proxy/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header HOST $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_pass http://172.17.0.1:8080/;
    }
}
```

# Build and test local

```
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

# Notes

* By default we use a selfsigned certificate, to enable let's encrypt you need to pass the command `-r`
* if you are using the default nginx config, you can define the port of the vhost using the variables `NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` and `NGINX_HTTP_PORT`
* When using a custom vhost config, you can define a backend dynamically using the variable `NGINX_BACKEND`
* the nginx main config need to be copy to `/devops/nginx-main.conf`, the entrypoint script copy the file to `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, if this file is not defined a default one is used.
* the nginx vhost config need to be copy to `/devops/nginx-vhost.conf`, the entrypoint script copy the file to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`, if this file is not defined a default one is used.
* we use a symlink to point the letsencrypt folder (/etc/letsencrypt) to /mnt/data/letsencrypt, if we need to persist data a docker volume can be point to that folder
    * if no volume is use, the certificate are generate every time the container star
* the certificate and private key generated by letsencrypt are store in this locations:
    * /etc/letsencrypt/live/proxy/fullchain.pem;
    * /etc/letsencrypt/live/proxy/privkey.pem;
